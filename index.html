            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>As a motivated IT professional currently pursuing a degree in computer software and database devlopment with a passion for technology, 
                I am eager to contribute my knowledge and learn through a cooperative education opportunity. While I may not have 
                professional experience yet, I am dedicated, quick to learn, and possess strong problem-solving skills. I am excited
                 to gain hands-on experience, collaborate with professionals, and apply my academic knowledge to real-world IT 
                 projects, making a meaningful impact in the industry.</p>
                <p>
                Throughout my career, I have successfully collaborated with cross-functional teams, including designers
                and product managers, to translate business requirements into robust and user-friendly applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to technical skills, I possess leadership qualities, a calm demeanor, and a friendly attitude, 
                making me well-rounded and effective in collaborating with teams and handling diverse situations.

            <h3>E-commerce Website</h3>
            <p>Using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a back-end framework like Node.js, I created
                a completely functional e-commerce website.
                Products listings, shopping cart functionality, user authentication, and payment integration are some of
                the features that have been implemented. Utilized a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store product
                information and user data.</p>
